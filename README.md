## Description
NYC Pathfinder is a project that implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid representation of New York City. The algorithm visualizes the search process and the resulting path using `matplotlib`.

## Features

- **A* Search Algorithm**: Efficiently finds the shortest path using heuristic-based optimization.
- **Grid Visualization**: Displays the grid, search process and final path 
- **Real-time Animation**: Shows the search progress and updates the path dynamically.


## Dependencies 

numpy=1.16.4 

matploblib=3.1.0

Conda Environment required if unexpected errors occur
